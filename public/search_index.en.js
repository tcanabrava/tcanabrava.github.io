exciting being added, mostly because the software is ready, why should we modify something that works to add experimental features?\n\nBut then the reality kicked in, konsole missed some features that are quite nice and existed in Terminator, Tilix and other new terminals, but Tilix now lacks a developer, and Terminator is also not being actively developed (with the last release being it in 26 of February of 2017)\nKonsole is tougth as a powerhouse of the terminal emulators, having too many things that are quite specific for some use cases, and it's really tricky to remove a feture (even when it's half-broken) because some people do rely in that behavior, so my first idea is to modernize the codebase so I can actually start to code.\nIt's been around one year that I send patches regularly to Konsole now, and I don't plan to stop.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/hello-new-konsole/","title":"Hello new Konsole"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/is-this-still-on/":{"body":"It's been a Long long time

And differently from KConfigXT, the code is smaller, easier to read, and does not rely on magic enums, nor it has a lot of different possibilities to fine tune the settings - if you want to choose between runtime or compile time file, shared vs non shared config, etc.: KConfigXT is for you, mine is supposed to be simple and up to the point.\n\nThat Preferences will generate all the corresponding C++ classes with the needed boilerplate for a Qt application to handle settings, in a safe way - no more strings for keys on code.\nPreferences::self()-&gt;some()-&gt;inner()-&gt;group()-&gt;setValue(15);\nPreferences::self()-&gt;general()-&gt;setBeatsPerMinute(10);\n\nAll of the preferences are exported as Q_PROPERTIES using snake_case\nso you use it directly on Qml.\nSomeQmlElement {\n    width: preferences.window.width\n}\n\nIf you want to set specific rules to the Preferences values, this is done in c++, using the setRule variants of the settings:\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n   QApplication app(argc, argv);\n   Preferences::self()-&gt;some()-&gt;inner()-&gt;group()-&gt;setValueRule([](int value) { return value &lt; 90; });\n}\n\nThe defaut values can be queried with Default variants:\n  Preferences::self()-&gt;some()-&gt;inner()-&gt;group-&gt;valueDefault();\n\nThere's no code to automatically handle ui files, like KConfigXT, nor there will be. create your connects by hand using this.\nThe source is at https://github.com/tcanabrava/configuration-parser\nCurrently the build produces two binaries: one for qsettings, one for kconfig.\n(if anyone is better at cmake than myself, I'd appreicate some help on ConfigurationCompiler.cmake, as it's not correctly generating the targets on a 3rd party project)\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/kconfig-alternate/","title":"KConfigXT Alternative Generator"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/konsole-in-2020/":{"body":"Konsole is having a resurge in the moment, it's the terminal emulator of choice\nfor the power user that wants to break the 4th wall in *nix systems.

How\nyou can now select what kind of broadcast group a terminal belongs to, any\nterminal that belongs to the same group will send data to it, there's also a\nNone group - for terminals that should not send data anywhere, and a Broadcast to All groups, that will push data everywhere - despite being in the group or\nnot. (not merged yet)\n{% include youtube.html id=\"PmI-t-nGsKs\" %}\nSupport for URL Escape Codes. There's a spec that specifies how a terminal\napplication can embbed a URL inside of a block of text, by using the special\nnotation: \\e]8;;http://www.kde.org\\e\\\\click here\\e]8;;\\e\\\\\\n this is equivalent\nto the html code &lt;a href=\"http://www.kde.org&gt; click here &lt;/a&gt; and there's a\nwork in progress implementation for that in the works (featuring a VIP list of\naccepted schemas, currently only file, http and https are allowed, but the user\ncan overrite)\n{% include youtube.html id=\"R_caJmf142Y\" %}\nThose are all of the features that I worked (minus tons of bugfixes, security\nimprovements and general rewrites that are unrelated to new features). I hope\nyou all enjoy the new konsole, that is still one of the fastest terminal\nemulators around, even tough it's packed with features for the experienced and\nnovice user.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/konsole-in-2020/","title":"Konsole in 2020"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/konsole-in-2021/":{"body":"This year konsole kept the momentum it gained in 2020, and implemented quite\na lot of userful new features.

By the skillfull hands of Adriaan\nde Groot, our bsd wizzard.\nWe also implemented a plugin system for konsole, and the first plugin\nimplemented is a putty like interface to manage SSH sessions\n![A Puty like  interface for ssh]({{ site.url }}/images/konsole_ssh_plugin.pcg)\nAll in all, we had around 200 commits for konsole this year, and that's a\npretty good shape - one of the most active projects for terminals all around.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/konsole-in-2021/","title":"Konsole in 2021"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/konsole-splits/":{"body":"Some terminals like Tilix and Terminator offers the possibility to split the screen recursively, and I started to add the same thing to konsole.

One of my first patches to konsole was the rewrite of the Tab Bar, and a different way to deal with Drag &amp; Drop of the tabs. In my mind - and how wrong I was - I could assume that I was dragging to a konsole main window by querying the widget below the mouse.\n\nNope, this will not work. As Wayland has security by default, it will not give you anything global. What if I was a spy app trying to record another one to send to NSA? Security in Wayland is much stricter, and because of that I had to redo my drag &amp; drop patch.\nKonsole should work now with drag &amp; drop of tabs in Wayland, as soon as the patch hits master.

But a project as big as konsole needs more people.\nThree new developers joined konsole and are activelly fixing things over the past year, no plans to stop.\nTerminator / Tilix split mode is working\nA few features to be completely equal to minix / terminator is missing, but not hard to implement\n\nNow it has more developers and more code flowing, fixing bugs, improving the interface, increasing the number of lines of code flowing thru the codebase. We don't plan to stop supporting konsole, and it will not depend on a single developer anymore.\nWe want konsole to be the swiss army knife of terminal emulators, you can already do with konsole a lot of things that are impossible in other terminals, but we want more. And we need more developers for that.\nKonsole is, together with VTE, the most used terminal out there in numbers of applications that integrate the technology: Dolphin, Kate, KDevelop, Yakuake, and many other applications also use konsole, so fixing a bug in one place we are helping a lot of other applications too.\nConsider joining a project, Consider sending code. \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/the-state-of-terminals-in-linux/","title":"The state of Terminal Emulators in Linux"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/about/":{"body":1,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/hello-new-konsole/":{"body":91,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/is-this-still-on/":{"body":31,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/kconfig-alternate/":{"body":222,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/konsole-in-2020/":{"body":330,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/konsole-in-2021/":{"body":109,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/konsole-splits/":{"body":99,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/konsole-wayland/":{"body":83,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/the-state-of-terminals-in-linux/":{"body":247,"title":4}},"length":10},"lang":"English"};
