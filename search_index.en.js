Weekly Update\"\nWhat is Codevis?\nCodevis is a tool to help developers manage large codebases, sponsored by Bloomberg, developed by Codethink and hosted on the KDE Infrastructure, with all that, completely opensource with a permissive license. Codevis uses a mix of technologies to do what it does, mainly LLVM and Clang to do the heavy lifting of understanding C++ Codebases, Qt for Callback management (in the form of Signal/Slots), KDE Frameworks libraries for the desktop application, and pure Qt for the CLI application. The database layer is written with Soci , the same database layer used in CERN, targeting sqlite3.\nBut How does it work?\nCodevis analyzes all the visible source code from your project and creates a graph database (using a relational database) in a way that the analyst can load and interpret information from the codebase without loading the codebase. The graph-database is comprehensive, and has all the information we think it's important, and also a lot of information that's good to have, with a bunch of information because why not. Since something that's not important for me could be really important for a company with billions of lines of code.\nIt just generates visualization?\nNo. Codevis also allows you to draw your software architecture and generate ready-to-compile c++ code from it. Think of this as a possibility to have C++ templates for complex projects tha are also visually documented. You can create libraries, classes, structures, connect them quickly on a dirty mockup during a meeting, and the output could be 60 c++ files on disk with all the classes, folder-hierarchy and CMake ready to compile.\nThis will not add any method or implement anything, but just the creation of the C++ files and CMake scripts from a small architecture meeting is pretty interesting in my point of view.\nYeah, but isn't UML alreday that?\nNo. UML is quite more complex and harder to use for large scale visualization, and the UML code generation doesn't really takes buildability in mind. You can't generate an entire project from a UML definition.\nYou say that it's a large scale, but my proejct is small. it will also help me?\nCodevis will analyze everything, every single include that you use (even if it's not from your project), helping you decide the best usage for libraries and visualizing the graph with different graph algorithms - making sure that the physical software layout is organized (not just the logical architecture).\nImprove it with Plugins\nWe support C++ and Python plugins so you can implement things that might be important for your corporation (and by corporation I mean Gnome, KDE, RedHat, Collabora, etc) and integrate the software in ways that the developers didn't think of.\nCI integration?\nImagine that you need to make sure the architecture of the software is stable. Architecture is not something that is easy to do unittests for. it can also be a complex architecture so it's hard to see if all my new header and source files are implementing (or correctly integrating) into new architecture.\nwith Codevis you can use the cli tools and extract the code information on a CI step, load the database and run a plugin that checks if the whole architecture of the system is correct, based on heuristics.\nIs everything you said here production ready?\nNo. This is also an appeal for help. we are developing and we have almost everything here running correcty, some parts are missing, specially, people using and testing is missing. We appreciate if people download, compile, try.\n","id":"https://tcanabrava.github.io/codevis-weekly-update/","title":"Codevis Weekly Update"},"https://tcanabrava.github.io/hello-new-konsole/":{"body":"Konsole has been ready for many many years, and got almost 10 years without anything really exciting being added, mostly because the software is ready, why should we modify something that works to add experimental features?\n\nBut then the reality kicked in, konsole missed some features that are quite nice and existed in Terminator, Tilix and other new terminals, but Tilix now lacks a developer, and Terminator is also not being actively developed (with the last release being it in 26 of February of 2017)\nKonsole is tougth as a powerhouse of the terminal emulators, having too many things that are quite specific for some use cases, and it's really tricky to remove a feture (even when it's half-broken) because some people do rely in that behavior, so my first idea is to modernize the codebase so I can actually start to code.\nIt's been around one year that I send patches regularly to Konsole now, and I don't plan to stop.\n","id":"https://tcanabrava.github.io/hello-new-konsole/","title":"Hello new Konsole"},"https://tcanabrava.github.io/is-this-still-on/":{"body":"It's been a Long long time without posting anything.

And differently from KConfigXT, the code is smaller, easier to read, and does not rely on magic enums, nor it has a lot of different possibilities to fine tune the settings - if you want to choose between runtime or compile time file, shared vs non shared config, etc.: KConfigXT is for you, mine is supposed to be simple and up to the point.\n\nThat Preferences will generate all the corresponding C++ classes with the needed boilerplate for a Qt application to handle settings, in a safe way - no more strings for keys on code.\nPreferences::self()-&gt;some()-&gt;inner()-&gt;group()-&gt;setValue(15);\nPreferences::self()-&gt;general()-&gt;setBeatsPerMinute(10);\n\nAll of the preferences are exported as Q_PROPERTIES using snake_case\nso you use it directly on Qml.\nSomeQmlElement {\n    width: preferences.window.width\n}\n\nIf you want to set specific rules to the Preferences values, this is done in c++, using the setRule variants of the settings:\nint main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\n   QApplication app(argc, argv);\n   Preferences::self()-&gt;some()-&gt;inner()-&gt;group()-&gt;setValueRule([](int value) { return value &lt; 90; });\n}\n\nThe defaut values can be queried with Default variants:\n  Preferences::self()-&gt;some()-&gt;inner()-&gt;group-&gt;valueDefault();\n\nThere's no code to automatically handle ui files, like KConfigXT, nor there will be. create your connects by hand using this.\nThe source is at https://github.com/tcanabrava/configuration-parser\nCurrently the build produces two binaries: one for qsettings, one for kconfig.\n(if anyone is better at cmake than myself, I'd appreicate some help on ConfigurationCompiler.cmake, as it's not correctly generating the targets on a 3rd party project)\n","id":"https://tcanabrava.github.io/kconfig-alternate/","title":"KConfigXT Alternative Generator"},"https://tcanabrava.github.io/konsole-in-2020/":{"body":"Konsole is having a resurge in the moment, it's the terminal emulator of choice\nfor the power user that wants to break the 4th wall in *nix systems.
