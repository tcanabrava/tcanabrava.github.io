title: "Konsole and Splits"
---

Some terminals like Tilix and Terminator offers the possibility to split the screen recursively, and I started to add the same thing to konsole. Konsole is usually said to be the swiss army knife of the terminal emulators, and if you didn't try it yet, please do. We offer quite a lot of things that no other terminal emulator offer.

Rigth now this code is in review but it currently supports quite a few things:
- Allow to Drag & drop the tab to create a new window of konsole
- Allow to Drag & drop the tab back into another window
- Allow to Drag & drop a split to reposition it in the current tab
- Allow to Drag & drop a split to another tab
- Allow to Drag & drop a split to another window (if in the same process)

Expect this to be in the next version of konsole if all goes well.
