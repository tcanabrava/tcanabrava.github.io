This year konsole kept the momentum it gained in 2020, and implemented quite
a lot of userful new features. We Finally implemented Reflow, thanks to the
combined effort of me and Carlos Alves - that was one of the most requested
features of konsole for the entire history of the project.

Ahmad Samir fixed *tons* of issues in konsole, all around the codebase, he's
the person with most commits on konsole this year, praise to him.

Waqar has been on a spree speeding konsole by a factor of too much - he's single
handly managed to make scrolling in konsole twice as fast, and we are now almost
as fast as the fastest terminals, and the fastest terminals don't offer what
konsole offers.

FreeBSD got a bit of love under konsole, too. By the skillfull hands of Adriaan
de Groot, our bsd wizzard.

We also implemented a plugin system for konsole, and the first plugin
implemented is a putty like interface to manage SSH sessions

# ![A Puty like  interface for ssh]({{ site.url }}/images/konsole_ssh_plugin.pcg)

All in all, we had around 200 commits for konsole this year, and that's a
pretty good shape - one of the most active projects for terminals all around.
